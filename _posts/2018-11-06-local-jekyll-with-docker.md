Development Time!

### Installation

Managing dependencies can be a real headache. Let's avoid doing that *as much as possble*.

### Welcome, Docker.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

We will be using Docker to replicate the compiling process Github Pages applies to our repositories, on our local machines.

This will allow us to rapidly test changes without messing with our live site.

### Install Docker

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - **Windows** & **OS X**

[Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/) - **Linux**

Check your install version:
~~~~~~~~
> docker --version
~~~~~~~~

Run standard *hello-world* test:
~~~~~~~~
> docker run hello-world
~~~~~~~~




Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
