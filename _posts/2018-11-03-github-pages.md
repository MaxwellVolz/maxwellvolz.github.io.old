### 1. What is it?

Github keeps track of your files in a **repository** (think folder) on the internet, and if the files in the folder follow a specific pattern...Github converts them into a formatted website called a Github Page. They describe it as [websites for you and your projects](https://pages.github.com/).

### 2. Cool! 

**I know.** It *is* cool. 


### Tell me more.

* It's **free**
* Markdown is the fastest way for a human to output formatted text
* All your updates are version tracked because it's on Git!
* Developer setup is operating system agnostic ([more on that later!](/2018/11/04/local-jekyll-with-docker))

### Fire it up!
