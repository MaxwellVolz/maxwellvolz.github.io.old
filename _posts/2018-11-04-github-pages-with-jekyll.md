### What is Markdown?

> **Markdown** is a lightweight *markup* language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

The beauty of Markdown is its ease of use. [Single Page PDF Cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf)

### Try it!

I use [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) daily for organizing my notes and documentation. It makes me feel like that girl in junior high with the 30-pack of highlighters and color-coordinated binders for every class. Epic.
