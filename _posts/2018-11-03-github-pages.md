### What is Github Pages?

Github keeps track of your files in a **repository** (think folder) on the internet, and if the files in the folder follow a specific pattern...Github converts them into a formatted website called a Github Page. They describe it as [websites for you and your projects](https://pages.github.com/).

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner. Thanks Tom! Also, it is heavy integrated with Github Pages.

### Benefits
* It's **free**
* Markdown is the fastest way for a human to output formatted text
* All your updates are version tracked because it's on Git!
* Developer setup is operating system agnostic ([more later!](/2018/11/06/local-jekyll-with-docker))
